QUESTION->Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
ANSWER->
Big O notation is a mathematical concept used to describe the efficiency of algorithms, specifically their time complexity and space complexity. It helps in analyzing how the runtime or memory usage of an algorithm grows as the input size increases.
•	O(1): Constant time complexity. The runtime is independent of the input size.
•	O(n): Linear time complexity. The runtime grows linearly with the input size.
•	O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity. The runtime grows logarithmically with the input size, which is typically seen in algorithms that divide the problem size in each step.
•	O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity. The runtime grows quadratically with the input size, often seen in algorithms with nested loops.

QUESTION-> Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
ANSWER->
•	Best Case: The best-case scenario for a search operation occurs when the target element is located at the first position in the data structure.
•	Average Case: The average-case scenario involves a random distribution of elements and the target is found at a random position.
•	Worst Case: The worst-case scenario happens when the target element is at the last position or not present at all, leading to the maximum number of comparisons.

QUESTION-> Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.
ANSWER->
•  Linear Search:
•	Best Case: O(1) (if the element is at the first position)
•	Average Case: O(n) (element is found somewhere in the middle)
•	Worst Case: O(n) (element is at the end or not present)
•  Binary Search:
•	Best Case: O(1) (if the element is at the midpoint)
•	Average Case: O(log n) (element is found after log(n) comparisons)
•	Worst Case: O(log n) (element is not found but requires log(n) comparisons)

QUESTION-> Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
ANSWER->
•	For an e-commerce platform where the dataset is likely large and searches are frequent, binary search is more suitable due to its faster search time. Ensure that the product data is sorted before applying binary search. If the dataset is dynamic and frequently changing, consider maintaining a sorted order or using more advanced data structures like balanced binary search trees or hash-based structures to optimize performance further.

QUESTION 1-> Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems?
ANSWER->
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. The function typically solves a smaller instance of the same problem until it reaches a base case that can be solved directly.


QUESTION 2-> Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm?
ANSWER->
Time Complexity:
â€¢	Recursive Algorithm: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of periods, because the function makes a recursive call for each period.

QUESTION3-> Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation?
ANSWER->
The recursive approach is simple and clear for a small number of periods. For larger numbers of periods or more complex problems, an iterative approach might be more efficient, but for learning purposes, recursion is straightforward and easy to grasp.
